## 1. What Is This?

DeepBook V3 is a decentralized central limit order book (CLOB) built on the Sui blockchain. Think of it as a stock exchange smart contract: buyers and sellers post limit orders, and the contract matches them automatically. Building against it normally requires deploying to a shared testnet, waiting for transactions, and competing with other developers for network resources.

DeepBook Sandbox eliminates that friction. One command starts a private Sui blockchain on your machine, deploys the entire DeepBook protocol (smart contracts, token, oracle feeds, margin trading), creates a liquidity pool pre-filled with a market maker, and hands you a working dashboard. You get a complete exchange in Docker containers that resets cleanly every time.

After following this guide, you'll have a running local DeepBook instance with live order books, a faucet for free test tokens, real-time price feeds, and a React dashboard to monitor everything.

## 2. How It All Fits Together

```

The **Sui Localnet** container runs a full Sui blockchain node. The **deploy-all** script publishes all Move smart contracts (token, deepbook, margin, pyth) to this chain, then starts the supporting services. The **Oracle Service** pushes real Pyth Network prices for SUI and DEEP every 10 seconds. The **Market Maker** maintains a grid of buy/sell orders so the pool has liquidity. The **Indexer** reads blockchain checkpoints and writes events into **PostgreSQL**, and the **DeepBook Server** exposes that data as a REST API.

## 3. Prerequisites

- **Docker Desktop** — install from [docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (includes `docker compose`)
- **Node.js 18+** — `brew install node` (or download from nodejs.org)
- **pnpm** — `npm install -g pnpm`
- **Sui CLI** — `brew install sui` (version 1.63.2–1.64.1 recommended; run `sui --version` to verify)
- **(Optional) pre-commit** — `brew install pre-commit` (for git hook management)

Make sure Docker is actually running (the whale icon in your menu bar) before proceeding.

## 4. Configuration

For localnet, you only need to set one variable — the Sui container image for your CPU architecture. Copy the example file:

```bash
cd sandbox
cp .env.example .env
```

Then open `.env` and verify this line matches your machine:

```bash
# Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4):
SUI_TOOLS_IMAGE=mysten/sui-tools:mainnet-v1.63.3-arm64

# Intel/AMD:
# SUI_TOOLS_IMAGE=mysten/sui-tools:mainnet-v1.63.3
```

Everything else (`PRIVATE_KEY`, package IDs, oracle IDs, pool IDs) is auto-generated by `deploy-all`. You never need to fill those in manually for localnet.

See the full [Configuration Reference](#appendix-b-configuration-reference) at the end for all variables.

## 5. First-Time Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo with submodules
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MystenLabs/deepbook-sandbox.git
cd deepbook-sandbox

# 2. Install Node.js dependencies
cd sandbox
pnpm install
```

That's it for setup. The heavy lifting (downloading Docker images, deploying contracts) happens in the next step.

## 6. Core Usage — Launching the Sandbox

From the `sandbox/` directory:

```bash
pnpm deploy-all
```

> **Speed tip (Intel/AMD only):** Add `--quick` to skip building the indexer and server images from source:
>
> ```bash
> pnpm deploy-all --quick
> ```
>
> This uses pre-built Docker Hub images instead of compiling Rust locally — much faster, but the images are `linux/amd64` only. Apple Silicon users should use the default command above, which builds native ARM images from source.

Here's what happens behind the scenes:

1. **Docker containers start** — Sui Localnet and PostgreSQL spin up. The Sui node generates a fresh keypair and copies it to `deployments/.sui-keystore`.
2. **Key import** — The script reads the container's keypair, imports it into your host `sui` CLI, and configures a `localnet` environment pointing at `http://127.0.0.1:9000`.
3. **Deployer funded** — The script requests SUI from the built-in faucet so the deployer has gas for publishing.
4. **Move packages deployed** — Five packages are published in order: `token` (the DEEP coin), `deepbook` (the core order book), `deepbook_margin` (margin trading), `pyth` (oracle contracts), and supporting modules.
5. **Indexer + server + faucet start** — The indexer and server images are built from source (this compiles Rust, so it takes a few minutes the first time). Then the indexer starts reading checkpoints from the Sui node, the REST server comes online on port 9008, and the faucet service starts on port 9009. With `--quick`, the build step is skipped and pre-built Docker Hub images are used instead.
6. **Pyth oracles created** — Price feed objects for SUI, DEEP, and USDC are created on-chain. A dedicated oracle keypair is generated and funded (separate from the deployer to avoid gas coin conflicts).
7. **Oracle service starts** — Begins pushing real Pyth Network prices every 10 seconds.
8. **Pools created** — A DEEP/SUI pool and a SUI/USDC pool are created, along with SUI and USDC margin pools.
9. **Market maker starts** — Places a grid of buy/sell orders around the oracle mid-price, rebalancing every 10 seconds.
10. **Deployment manifest written** — All IDs are saved to `sandbox/deployments/localnet.json` and `sandbox/.env`.

When you see `DeepBook Sandbox Ready!`, everything is running:

| Endpoint                     | URL                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Sui RPC                      | [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)                 |
| Sui Faucet (native)          | [http://localhost:9123](http://localhost:9123)                 |
| DeepBook Faucet (SUI + DEEP) | [http://localhost:9009](http://localhost:9009)                 |
| DeepBook REST API            | [http://localhost:9008](http://localhost:9008)                 |
| Oracle Status                | [http://localhost:9010](http://localhost:9010)                 |
| Market Maker Health          | [http://localhost:3001/health](http://localhost:3001/health)   |
| Market Maker Metrics         | [http://localhost:9091/metrics](http://localhost:9091/metrics) |
| Indexer Metrics              | [http://localhost:9184/metrics](http://localhost:9184/metrics) |

## 7. Launching the Dashboard

The web dashboard is a separate React app (not part of the Docker stack):

```bash
cd sandbox/dashboard
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The dashboard has four pages:

- **Health** — Shows the status of all services (Sui node, indexer, oracle, market maker)
- **Market Maker** — Displays the market maker's active orders, rebalance count, and metrics
- **Faucet** — Connect a wallet and request SUI or DEEP tokens (requires a connected wallet)
- **Deployment** — Browse all deployed package addresses, pool IDs, and oracle object IDs

## 8. Day-to-Day Workflow

```bash
cd sandbox

# Start fresh (first time or after teardown)
pnpm deploy-all              # builds indexer/server from source
pnpm deploy-all --quick      # uses pre-built images (Intel/AMD only)

# Check that prices are updating
curl http://localhost:9010/

# Request tokens for your test address
curl -X POST http://localhost:9009/faucet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0x<your-address>","token":"DEEP","amount":500}'

# Request SUI tokens
curl -X POST http://localhost:9009/faucet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0x<your-address>","token":"SUI"}'

# Query the chain directly (your sui CLI is already configured)
sui client gas

# View market maker activity
docker compose logs -f market-maker

# View oracle updates
docker compose logs -f oracle-service

# Check all containers
docker compose ps

# Done for the day — full cleanup
pnpm down
```

## 9. Using the Faucet

The faucet service on port 9009 distributes both SUI and DEEP tokens. It's separate from the native Sui faucet (port 9123) because DEEP tokens require a signed transfer from the deployer's TreasuryCap.

**Request DEEP tokens** (default: 1000 DEEP, max: 10000 per request):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9009/faucet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0x1234...","token":"DEEP","amount":1000}'
```

**Request SUI tokens** (proxied to the native Sui faucet):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9009/faucet \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"0x1234...","token":"SUI"}'
```

**Check faucet info:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:9009/
```

**Get the deployment manifest:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:9009/manifest
```

## 10. Rebuilding / Destructive Operations

**Full teardown** — stops all containers, removes volumes, and cleans auto-generated keys:

```bash
cd sandbox
pnpm down
```

| What                                                            | Destroyed?                    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Docker containers                                               | Yes — all stopped and removed |
| Docker volumes (chain data, postgres)                           | Yes — wiped clean             |
| Auto-generated .env keys (package IDs, oracle IDs, pool IDs)    | Yes — cleaned                 |
| User-set .env values (NETWORK, SUI*TOOLS_IMAGE, MM*\* settings) | No — preserved                |
| Deployment manifest (deployments/localnet.json)                 | No — kept for reference       |
| Your source code                                                | Never                         |
| Dashboard code/config                                           | Never                         |

> **Note:** By default, `FORCE_REGENESIS=true` means the Sui node wipes chain state on every restart. Set it to empty in `.env` if you want data to persist across `deploy-all` runs.

**Re-deploy without teardown** — just run `pnpm deploy-all` again (or `pnpm deploy-all --quick` on Intel/AMD). It will overwrite the `.env` with new package IDs and force-recreate containers.

## 11. Working with DeepBook Move Code

The DeepBook V3 smart contracts live in a git submodule at `external/deepbook/`:

```bash
# Initialize submodule (if you didn't clone with --recurse-submodules)
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Build the Move package
cd external/deepbook/packages/deepbook
sui move build

# Run tests
sui move test
sui move test --skip-fetch-latest-git-deps  # faster if deps haven't changed

# Format Move files
bunx prettier-move -c *.move --write
```

## 12. Troubleshooting

**"Set SUI_TOOLS_IMAGE in .env"** — You forgot to copy `.env.example` to `.env`, or the `SUI_TOOLS_IMAGE` line is empty. Run `cp .env.example .env` from the `sandbox/` directory.

**"Timed out waiting for deployments/.sui-keystore"** — The Sui container crashed before generating its key. Check `docker logs sui-localnet` for the error. Common cause: wrong `SUI_TOOLS_IMAGE` for your CPU architecture.

**"Failed to connect to Sui RPC"** — Docker is not running, or the Sui container hasn't started yet. Run `docker ps` to check.

**"Transaction failed" in oracle service** — The oracle's dedicated keypair ran out of SUI. This shouldn't happen since `deploy-all` funds it automatically. If it does, check `docker logs oracle-service` and re-run `pnpm deploy-all`.

**Deploy takes a long time building Rust images** — The indexer and server are Rust services that compile from source by default. This is normal on first run (can take several minutes). On Intel/AMD machines, you can skip the build with `pnpm deploy-all --quick` to use pre-built Docker Hub images. Apple Silicon users must build from source since Docker Hub only publishes `linux/amd64` images.

**Port conflicts** — Another process is using port 9000, 5432, or 9123. Stop the conflicting process or change ports in `docker-compose.yml`.

**Dashboard can't connect** — Make sure the sandbox is running (`docker compose ps`). The dashboard talks to `localhost:9009` for the faucet and `localhost:9000` for the RPC.

## Appendix C: How It Boots (Under the Hood)

When you run `pnpm deploy-all`, here's the full sequence:

1. **Env bootstrap** — If `PRIVATE_KEY` is missing, a placeholder keypair is generated so `docker-compose.yml` can parse its `${PRIVATE_KEY:?...}` variable validation. If `SUI_TOOLS_IMAGE` is missing, it's auto-detected based on CPU architecture (`arm64` vs `x86_64`).
2. **Docker compose up (localnet profile)** — Starts `sui-localnet` and `postgres` containers only. The Sui container runs `sui client new-address ed25519`, copies the keystore to a shared volume (`deployments/.sui-keystore`), and launches the node with `--force-regenesis` and `--with-faucet`.
3. **RPC polling** — The script polls `http://127.0.0.1:9000` every 2 seconds until it responds (up to 60 attempts). Then polls the faucet at port 9123.
4. **Key import** — Reads the last entry from the container's keystore file, reconstructs the Ed25519 keypair, imports it into the host `sui` CLI with `sui keytool import`, creates a `localnet` environment, and switches to it.
5. **Faucet funding** — Requests SUI from the built-in faucet to fund the deployer address for gas.
6. **Move deployment** — Publishes five packages in dependency order. Each `sui client publish` transaction creates objects (TreasuryCap, package ID, etc.) that are parsed and stored.
7. **Env file update** — All package IDs, object IDs, and `FIRST_CHECKPOINT=0` are written to `sandbox/.env`.
8. **Indexer + server + faucet start** — Builds the indexer and server images from source (`--build`), then starts `deepbook-indexer`, `deepbook-server`, and `deepbook-faucet` containers with `--force-recreate` so they pick up the new env vars. With `--quick`, the build step is skipped and the pre-built Docker Hub images are used as-is.
9. **Pyth oracle setup** — Creates PriceInfoObjects on-chain for SUI, DEEP, and USDC. Generates a separate Ed25519 keypair for the oracle service, funds it via faucet, and saves `ORACLE_PRIVATE_KEY` to `.env`.
10. **Oracle service start** — Starts the `oracle-service` container, which immediately begins fetching 24-hour-old prices from `benchmarks.pyth.network` and submitting update transactions every 10 seconds.
11. **Pool creation** — Creates a DEEP/SUI pool and a SUI/USDC pool on-chain via the DeepBook contract. Also creates SUI and USDC margin pools. Pool IDs are written to `.env`.
12. **Market maker start** — Starts the `market-maker` container. It creates a BalanceManager, funds it with DEEP and SUI, and begins placing a grid of POST_ONLY limit orders around the oracle mid-price.
13. **Manifest written** — A JSON deployment manifest with all addresses, pool IDs, and oracle IDs is saved to `sandbox/deployments/localnet.json`.

| `deepbook-indexer` | `deepbook-indexer`      | `remote`, `localnet` | 9184:9184              | Reads checkpoints, writes events to Postgres    |
| `deepbook-server`  | `deepbook-server`       | `remote`, `localnet` | 9008:9008, 9185:9184   | REST API for querying indexed DeepBook data     |
| `deepbook-faucet`  | `deepbook-faucet`       | `localnet`, `remote` | 9009:9009              | Distributes SUI (proxied) and DEEP tokens       |
| `oracle-service`   | `oracle-service`        | `localnet`           | 9010:9010              | Updates Pyth price feeds every 10 seconds       |

## Appendix E: Glossary

**Balance Manager** — A shared on-chain object that holds all token balances for a DeepBook account. One owner, up to 1000 authorized traders.

**CLOB (Central Limit Order Book)** — A trading system where buyers and sellers post limit orders at specific prices, and the system matches them. DeepBook is a CLOB implemented as a Sui smart contract.

**DEEP Token** — The native utility token for DeepBook. Required for trading fees. Can be staked for reduced fees and governance voting.

**Grid Strategy** — The market maker's approach: place N buy orders below the mid-price and N sell orders above it, evenly spaced, then cancel and re-place them every rebalance interval.

**Move** — The smart contract programming language used by Sui. DeepBook's core logic is written in Move.

**Pool** — A DeepBook trading venue for a specific token pair (e.g., DEEP/SUI). Contains a Book (order matching engine), State (user data, volumes, governance), and Vault (settlement).

**POST_ONLY** — An order restriction that ensures the order is a maker order (adds liquidity). If it would immediately match, it's rejected instead. The market maker uses this exclusively.

**Pyth Network** — A decentralized oracle network that provides real-time price data. The oracle service fetches SUI and DEEP prices from Pyth and publishes them on-chain.

**PriceInfoObject** — A Sui on-chain object created by the Pyth oracle contract that stores the latest price for a specific asset.
